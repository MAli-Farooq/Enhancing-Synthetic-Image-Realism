# Enhancing-Synthetic-Image-Realism
This work focuses on improving the visual fidelity of synthetic images using controlled diffusion models, guided text prompts, and super-resolution techniques. Our approach aims to generate high-quality, realistic samples suitable for downstream tasks in computer vision and generative AI. Includes a modular pipeline with ControlNet integration and optimization strategies for faster processing.
